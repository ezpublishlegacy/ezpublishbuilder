How to install and use eZ Publish Builder
=========================================

This is a 5 steps tutorial.


1. Download the pakefile script (once)
--------------------------------------

    cd <my_build_directory>
    wget http://svn.projects.ez.no/ezpublishbuilder/stable/pakefile.php


2. Launch the pakefile script for the first time (once)
-------------------------------------------------------

The script is able to bootstrap, ie. to download all missing components the
first time that you run it: ::

    php pakefile.php

This will create a directory ./pake/ and download into it all needed stuff from http://svn.projects.ez.no/ezpublishbuilder.

3. Edit the configuration file (once)
------------------------------------------------

The starting configuration file is provided by the extension: ./pake/options-ezpublish.yaml

The system will also load a 2nd config. file: options-ezpublish-user.yaml.
This file is not kept in github and is a good place to store data which is either
sensitive or local to your environment, such as passwords or paths to cli tools.
It has the same format as options-ezpublish.yaml

Parameters that you will have to put in it:
- jenkins username
- jenkins api-token (visible in your user profile page)
- toolx/xxx

4. Clone the CI git repository to your computer (once)
------------------------------------------------------

This task is partially automated via the script:

If you have already installed a clone of the CI git repository, just edit the
local configuration file ./pake/options-ezpublish-user.yaml and set the path to it.

If you have not,
a. edit the configuration file ./pake/options-ezpublish-user.yaml and set the path
   to where it has to be downloaded
b. run php pakefile.php init-ci-repo
c. alter the git configuration file in the directory where the CI repo has been
   cloned, adding a username and email
d. test that you have permissions to execute pushes on the upstream repository

5. Clone the eZ Publish git repositories to your computer (once)
----------------------------------------------------------------

This task is partially automated via the script:

b. run php pakefile.php init
c. alter the git configuration file in the directory where the repositories have been
   cloned, in build/source/ezpublish, adding a username and email
d. test that you have permissions to execute pushes on the upstream repositories

6. Edit the configuration file (for every build)
------------------------------------------------

Parameters that you will have to change:
- version number
- git revisions for previous version (if it has not been properly tagged in all git repositories)

Note that for all builds, version number can be given on the command line, thus
you will not need to edit options-ezpublish.yaml every time.


7. Launch the build (for every build)
-------------------------------------

To get a list of all available tasks run::

    php pakefile.php --tasks

To get a list of all available tasks, with dependencies, run::

    php pakefile.php --prereqs

The build process consists more or less of the following steps:

- INIT phase:
  - initialize local copies of git repositories (run only once)

- BUILD phase:
  - update local copies of git repositories
  - generate a changelog file from git commit messages
  - allow user to edit by hand the changelog to make it perfect
  - upload changelog file to the CI repository (it is used later by the jenkins builds),
    together with some other updates to patch files (the CI repo is used by the Jenkins build)
  - start the builds on jenkins

- DIST phase
  - download build artifact (the eZP tarball) locally, to allow testing
  - generate documentation
  - generate the WPI package for the MS WebMatrix (deprecated since move to eZ 5.x)

- extra tasks, not yet part of standard process:
  - tag the existing revisions on the upstream github revisions
  - generate html version of changelog to be usd for updating share.ez.no
  - update the version history file on pubsvn.ez.no
