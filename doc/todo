# global

. fix generation of docs w. phpdoc: remove cache folders after run
  (see also https://github.com/phpDocumentor/phpDocumentor2/issues/890)

. finish integration with v5:
  - automate checking for status of v5ee and v4 jobs before starting the "merge" job
  - rewrite the shell part of the v5-community task in php
  - let the script create tags for github repos (see below for details)
  - complete changelog generation in ezoe xml format (see below for details)
  - the WPI generation has to be reviewed

. simplify (if possible) the process of generating patches for the ci repo

. finish task: generate html version of changelog from txt version (test copy+paste it into online editor on share.ez.no)

. init tasks: set up user info in git for later allowing pushing to upstream repos

. new task: tag the builds in jenkins with correct "keep forever" and "description" data (step YY in the instructions)

. new task: generate upgrade instructions, checking for the need to run sql script
  (ideally, sql upgrade scripts should be put in the diff files on ci.ez.no,
  so that they are bundled with the release)

. new task: create on share.ez.no release notes, changelog, upgrade instructions (using ezcontenstaging rest api?)

. decide std name of install dir (??? as in "subdir of web root directory"?)

. all pake tasks: download, build, ...
  - replace version nr. in install dir ? (nb: not for ms web app package) (???)

. new task: integrate with grunt.js (or node.js - but why?)


# update-ci-repo task

. give user chance to break after seeing info about package repo url?
. allow script to run in --force mode, that avoids waiting for user input
. update the version number in the sql schema and .dba file

# init, init-ci-repo, update-ci-repo, generate-changelog tasks

. check for errors from all git commands (eg. for bad perms)

# init-ci-repo  task

. allow task to set up username and email automatically for git, and also to test push to upstream

# init-dist task

. recover the jenkins build number from jenkins (is it possible? we did not tag it yet...)

# init, init-ci-repo tasks

. if repos already exist locally, run an update instead of trying full download

# misc

. ez pull reqs:
  - add commented rule for static cache in .htaccess
  - add commented rule for cluster in .htaccess
