# global

. finish integration with v5:
  - automate checking for status of v5ee and v4 jobs before starting the "merge" job
  - rewrite the shell part of the v5-community task in php
  - let the script create tags for github repos (see below for details)
  - complete changelog generation in ezoe xml format (see below for details)
  - the WPI generation has to be reviewed

. init tasks: set up user info in git for later allowing pushing to upstream repos

. finish task: generate html version of changelog from txt version (test copy+paste it into online editor on share.ez.no)

. new task: upload wpi tarball to http://share.ez.no/ez-on-mswebplatform/ after building it (step XX in the instructions)

. new task: tag the builds in jenkins with correct "keep forever" and "description" data (step YY in the instructions)

. new task: generate upgrade instructions, checking for the need to run sql script
  (ideally, sql upgrade scripts should be put in the diff files on ci.ez.no,
  so that they are bundled with the release)

. new task: create on share.ez.no release notes, changelog, upgrade instructions (using ezcontenstaging rest api)

. decide std name of install dir (??? as in "subdir of web root directory"?)

. all pake tasks: download, build, ...
  - replace version nr. in install dir ? (nb: not for ms web app package) (???)

. new task: integrate with grunt.js


# update-ci-repo task

. give user chance to break after seeing info about package repo url?
. allow script to run in --force mode, that avoids waiting for user input
. update the version number in the sql schema and .dba file

# init, init-ci-repo, update-ci-repo, generate-changelog tasks

. check for errors from all git commands (eg. for bad perms)

# init-ci-repo  task

. allow task to set up username and email automatically for git, and also to test push to upstream

# init-dist task

. recover the jenkins build number from jenkins (is it possible? we did not tag it yet...)

# init, init-ci-repo tasks

. if repos already exist locally, run an update instead of trying full download


# Windows Web Application Gallery / Web Platform Installer package

nb: doc begins at http://learn.iis.net/page.aspx/619/windows-web-application-gallery/

. try to remove choice of pg from installer, while leaving mysql/mysqli
  (or shall we just set mysqli as std ?)

. q: does web installer does not test mysql credentials if 'use existing db' option chosen?
  a: most likely yes, but at a later step than entering them
  => shall we leave db config. setp in setup wizard visible?

. q: when does web installer ask for db amin credentials?
  a: only when user chooses 'create a new db'

. hide wizard step about url access method? (defaulting to 'url')

. pake tasks:
  - get sources
  - build

. test if feed file can have many versions of the same product (is it useful at all?)

. decide directory for downloadable files on share.ez.no

. check if packages dir has to be set to writeable


# pear package

. all pake tasks:
  - get sources
  - build
  - generate package file
  - update version nr in install dir in package file (?)
  - create zip


# misc

. iis rewrite rules for static cache:
http://learn.iis.net/page.aspx/761/provide-url-rewriting-functionality/

. mail iis forums: how to test for presence of rewrite module? also how to test if mysqli is active? and is there a way to force install of mysql connector for .net?
  OK (except for mysqli extension...)

. ez pull reqs:
  - add web.config-RECOMMENDED (resync with latest .htaccess): #xxx
  - add commented rule for static cache
  - add commented rule for cluster
