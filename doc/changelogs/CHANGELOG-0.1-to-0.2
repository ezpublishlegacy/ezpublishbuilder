Changes for version 0.2 - released 2012/2/6

*General:

This is a complete revamp of the script.
The goal is not anymore to be a complete build tool, but to support members of the CPB
with the currently overly long list of manual tasks involved in preparing a CP release.

Details
. "init" task can now initialize eZP sources from github
. "generate-changelog", "init-ci-repo", "update-ci-repo" and many more new tasks (see googledoc instructions for more details)
. release number can be passed on the command line after the name of the task. This allows to do many release without changing config file
. moved wpi-related files to a subdirectory (pake/wpifiles) for cleaner filesystem layout

*Bugfixes:
