Changes for version 0.5.0 - released 2013/11/13

*General:

. Moved to composer-based setup.
  We now require php 5.3, use classes and namespaces, cleaned up the codebase, etc...
  The "pake" dir is now only used to hold config files.
  Used templates are moved to the "resources" dir.
  Pake is not bundled anymore.

. on the CLI, both the directory for config files and the config files themselves can be specified

. removed options --doxygen, --docblox, --sami and --phpdoc to doc-generating task invocation.
  Use instead --option.tools.doxygen, --option.tools.docblox etc... 

. when generating changelog, categorize pull requests mentioning an issue based on their jira type if
  type is not evident by wording used in commit message

. the "dist" task does not include building MS-WPI packages by default anymore

*Bugfixes:

. remove the part after the "/" in attributing pull requests
